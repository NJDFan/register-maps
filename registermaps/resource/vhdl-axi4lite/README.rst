AXI4-Lite VHDL
==============

The AXI4-Lite VHDL format generates component VHDL template files.  These
templates rely on the packages generated by the basic VHDL output, which must
be generated separately.

The template includes boilerplate bus read and write procedures, along with 
reset logic, but obviously no logic for the actual implementation of
functionality which must be added separately.

.. warning:: Files from this output are made to be modified.  Do not do so in
   the creation directory where they can be accidentally overwritten by
   regenerating this output.  Move them manually to a working directory so that
   they can be safely edited.
