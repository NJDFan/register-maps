WISHBONE (Asynchronous Termination)
===================================

The WISHBONE Asynchronous Termination VHDL format generates component VHDL 
template files for a WISHBONE B4 bus.  This is a simpler mechanism than the 
registered feedback termination, but will ultimately present maximum clock 
frequency limitations on the bus.  As such, this implementation supports only 
classic cycles, it does not provide the LOCK_I or STALL_O signals. 
Additionally, only data granularity of 8 bits is supported and undefined tagged 
data signals TGD_I, TGD_O, TDA_I, and TGC_I need to be explicitly added by the 
user.

Slaves repond with ACK_O for accesses to valid register locations and ERR_O
for invalid locations.

The templates rely on the packages generated by the basic VHDL output, which
must be generated separately.

The template includes boilerplate bus read and write procedures, along with 
reset logic, but obviously no logic for the actual implementation of
functionality which must be added separately.

.. warning:: Files from this output are made to be modified.  Do not do so in
   the creation directory where they can be accidentally overwritten by
   regenerating this output.  Move them manually to a working directory so that
   they can be safely edited.
