WISHBONE (Registered Termination)
=================================

The WISHBONE Registered Termination VHDL format generates component VHDL 
template files for a WISHBONE B4 bus.  This takes advantage of the new,
simpler registered feedback mechanism in the B4 specification to provide
fast pipelined transactions with minimal logic.  Only the immediate address
is used, the CTI_I and BTI_I are not necessary.  STALL_O is provided to
demonstrate that it the mechanism is used, but is always deasserted.

Only data granularity of 8 bits is supported and undefined tagged data signals 
TGD_I, TGD_O, TDA_I, and TGC_I need to be explicitly added by the user.

Slaves repond with ACK_O for accesses to valid register locations and ERR_O
for invalid locations.

The templates rely on the packages generated by the basic VHDL output, which
must be generated separately.

The template includes boilerplate bus read and write procedures, along with 
reset logic, but obviously no logic for the actual implementation of
functionality which must be added separately.

.. warning:: Files from this output are made to be modified.  Do not do so in
   the creation directory where they can be accidentally overwritten by
   regenerating this output.  Move them manually to a working directory so that
   they can be safely edited.
